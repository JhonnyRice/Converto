# Converto
Batch Export Svg to Png on linux babe! (should work on every distro where inkscape is supported)


# How to use
you need to move (with the terminal, using cd) to the folder containing the svg files that you want to convert, then you execute the file, enter a width and height (if set to none the default is 48 for both width and height) and, magically, every svg file will be converted into a png file that you can find inside the converted_files directory or something like that.
> As of verison 1.0, every .png file present inside the folder containing the svgs will be moved into that directory, no one excluded.
